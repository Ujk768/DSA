/**
 * @brief 
 * 
 * if you have 3 graphs given to you in a question 
 * you dont say its 3 graphs its a disconnected graph with 3 different components 
 * 
 * 
 * every code we write will be for multiple components
 * we take a visited array of size=number of nodes initiallly marked as 0
 
 *  for(int i=0; i< visited.size();i++){
    if(!vis[i]){
        /dfs
        //bfs
        anything
    }
 }
 
 to find number of components count the number of time sthe coe runs in the if  statement
