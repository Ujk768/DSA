Sum of subset differences
Given a set of integers, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum.
If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.

Example:
Input:  arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 5} 
Output: 1
Explanation:
Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12 
Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11 


minimized(absolute) difference is the output so 1 is output

absolute difference should be minimum

this is very close to equal sum partition

 for every subset there are two extreme values you can select

 {} or {sum of all array elemets }

in this values only certain values can be formed from the Given
array elements

so when we get the candidates which can be formed from the 
range of array values

minimize s1-S2

s2 can be found from range -s1

so minimized expression is now range-2s1

0->range-s1

this will always be absolute because
 we are taking values only until range -s1 and s1 value will 
 always be smaller than this

all these values cant be used as for some of those values subset
cant be formed


basically first we have to check if there exists an element in the 
subset whose sum is 4
